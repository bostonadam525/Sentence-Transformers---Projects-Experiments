These\\nadvancements can be credited to the scaling of both model and dataset sizes, as well\\nas the incorporation of a second layer of training to better align the models with user\\nintent. This alignment is accomplished by fine-tuning the models via supervised learning on\\ndemonstrations of prompts and desired model behavior, and through reinforcement learning\\nfrom human preferences [5].\\nAs these models continue to evolve and become more powerful, an intriguing question arises:\\nCan we use the model itself to supervise its own behavior or that of other AI models?

While these models can produce content\\nthat matches the style of their teachers, they often fall short in terms of the reasoning and\\ncomprehension skills displayed by the larger foundation models.\\n4',\n",

However, a more meticulous\\nevaluation on reasoning benchmarks against human labels finds Vicuna to retain only 64%\\nof ChatGPT’s quality on professional and academic exams (see Figure 2), and only 48%of\\nChatGPT’s quality on complex benchmarks like BigBench-hard [ 11] (see Figure 3)5. This\\ndiscrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller\\nLLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\\nIn essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust\\nreasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose\\nstrategies for addressing them.\\n1.1 Challenges with Existing Methods\\nCurrent research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM’s like ChatGPT exhibits\\nnotable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations\\nare corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al. [12], where the authors assert that\\n“model imitation is a false promise” since “broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation\\nwould require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more\\ndiverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.”. Contrary to this\\nassertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is\\npossible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM’s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that\\nrequire sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\\nSimple instructions with limited diversity. The Self-Instruct [ 13] process involves using\\nan initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or\\noverly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated\\ninto the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through\\nSelf-Instruct, such as “what are the three primary colors?\", “what is the capital of France?\", etc. ,\\ncan exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [ 7] and WizardLM [ 8]\\nemploy a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which\\ngradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to\\novercome some of the method’s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works\\nlike Vicuna [ 9] and Koala [ 14] demonstrate remarkable performance due to more human-like\\nconversations and natural instructions in community-contributed conversations like those in\\nShareGPT6that provided a forum for users to share their conversations with ChatGPT.\\nTask diversity and data scaling. Human-contributed conversations in ShareGPT are a\\nvaluable source of data, but they also have some limitations.

              " 'content generation and information-seeking queries over other types of tasks. Therefore,\\nmodels trained on such natural conversations may capture the style but not the reasoning\\nprocess of the LFMs – demonstrated in the performance of Vicuna in Figures 2 and 3.\\nAdditionally, such mode of data collection is also limited in scale. Table 1 shows an overview\\nof the size of data and tuning methods employed in recent popular instruction tuning works.\\nLimited imitation signals. Existing methods rely on immitation learning from\\n⟨query, response⟩pairs generated by the teacher model. However, this provides limited\\nsignals to trace the reasoning process of the teacher. Prior works [ 15,16] on open-box model\\nshow that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can\\nsignificantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box\\nLFM’s7, recent work [ 17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close\\nthe gap for task-specific distillation.\\nEvaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely\\nlimited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking\\nit to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system\\n1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, this approach has\\nseveral drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g., 80instructions in Vicuna and 218\\ninstructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [ 18]. For example, we notice\\nthat models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts\\nthat GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate\\nresponses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of\\nsmaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and\\nreasoning skills.\\n1.2 Key Contributions\\nIn this research, our focus is on addressing the challenges mentioned above, specifically with:\\nExplanation tuning: We augment⟨query, response⟩pairs with detailed responses from\\nGPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These\\nprovide the student with additional signals for learning. We leverage system instructions (e.g..,\\nexplain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response , etc.) to\\nelicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the\\nprompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the\\nLFM’s “thought” process.\\nScaling tasks and instructions: We utilize the Flan 2022 Collection [ 19] as it provides\\nan extensive public assortment of tasks and instructions. Particularly, we use FLAN-\\nv2, supplemented with high-quality templates, advanced formatting patterns, and data\\naugmentations. Even though FLAN holds tens of millions of instructions, we selectively\\nsample from the task collection to form a diverse mixture of tasks, which we then further\\nsub-sample to generate complex prompts. These prompts are used to query LFMs like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set. We collect 5million\\nChatGPT responses, from which 1million is further sampled to acquire GPT-4 responses.\\nWe demonstrate how ChatGPT as a teacher assistant helps in progressive learning.\\nEvaluation: We assess the generative, reasoning, and comprehension abilities of Orca, under\\na range of settings: (i) AutoEvaluation with GPT-4 on existing evaluation sets from Vicuna,\\nWizardLM and the awesome prompts collection8; (ii) Academic benchmarks like Big-Bench\\nHard [4] and TruthfulQA [ 20]; (iii) Professional and Academic exams like SAT, LSAT, GRE,\\nGMAT from AGIEval [ 1]; (iv) Safety evaluation with ToxiGen [ 21] to test toxic language\\ngeneration and hate speech detection across different minority groups. Finally, we provide\\ncase-studies to compare the generation and reasoning abilities of Orca against OpenAI LFMs\\nlike ChatGPT and GPT-4, and instruction-tuned smaller model like Vicuna.\\n7Note that OpenAI API’s do give access to the top-5logits for each token.\\n8https://prompts.chat/\\n6',\n",

Existing works like Alpaca [ 7], Vicuna [ 9] and variants\\nfollow a similar template to train small models with ⟨{user instruction, input}, output ⟩.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Instruction Tuning\\nInstruction tuning [ 22] is a technique that allows pre-trained language models to learn\\nfrom input (natural language descriptions of the task) and response pairs, for example,\\n{\"instruction\": \"Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically\\ncorrect sentence.\", \"input\": \"the quickly brown fox jumped\", \"output\": \"the brown\\nfox jumped quickly\"} . Instruction tuning has been applied to both language-only and\\nmultimodal tasks. For language-only tasks, instruction tuning has been shown to improve\\nthe zero-shot and few-shot performance of models such as FLAN [ 22] and InstructGPT [ 5]\\non various benchmarks. For multimodal tasks, instruction tuning has been used to generate\\nsynthetic instruction-following data for language-image tasks, such as image captioning [ 23]\\nand visual question answering [24].\\nA wide range of works in recent times, including Alpaca [ 7], Vicuna [ 9], WizardLM [ 8] and\\nKoala [14], have adopted instruction-tuning to train smaller language models with outputs\\ngenerated from large foundation models from the GPT family. As outlined in Section 1.1,\\na significant drawback with all these works has been both limited task diversity, query\\ncomplexity and small-scale training data in addition to limited evaluation overstating the\\nbenefits of such approach.\\n2.2 Role of System Instructions\\nVanilla instruction-tuning (refer to Figure 4 for examples) often uses input, response pairs\\nwith short and terse responses. Such responses when used to train smaller models, as in\\nexisting works, give them limited ability to trace the reasoning process of the LFM.

For example,\\na set of system instructions designed for safety harness could be:\\n•The assistant must not generate harmful or offensive content.\\n•The assistant must respect the privacy and consent of the user.\\n•The assistant must acknowledge its limitations and uncertainties.\\n3 Explanation Tuning\\nTo address the shortcomings of existing works, we tap into large-scale training data with\\ndiverse tasks augmented with complex instructions and rich signals. Specifically, our data\\ncontains human and augmented system instructions for a large collection of tasks sampled\\nfrom FLAN-v2 (aka Flan 2022) [ 19]. Given the large size of the FLAN-v2 collection and\\nvarying number of examples for constituent datasets and tasks, we sample from a mixture of\\ntasks from different categories (described in the next section) to create our training data.\\n3.1 Dataset Construction\\nEach instance in our training data consists of the following triple: ⟨System message, User\\nquery, LFM response ⟩. Thesystem message , placed at the start of the prompt, provides\\nthe LFM with essential context, guidelines, and other pertinent details. We leverage the\\nsystem message to vary the length of the response; outline the assistant’s character; establish\\nacceptable and non-acceptable LFM behavior; and determine the structure of the agent’s\\nresponse. The user query defines the actual task we want the LFM to perform. To obtain\\na large and diverse set of user queries we utilize the FLAN-v2 collection [ 19]. We sample 5\\nmillion user queries from FLAN-v2 for which we collect ChatGPT responses. We further\\nsample 1million instructions from the 5million set for which we collect GPT-4 responses.\\nAll the queries to the agents are augmented with system instructions, as outlined below.\\n8',\n",
              " '3.1.1 System Messages\\nWe hand-craft a total of 16system messages designed to evoke different kinds of responses\\nfrom the LFM. This allows us to train Orca to generate long and short answers; follow\\nguidelines, instructions, and format; generate creative content as well as address information-\\nseeking queries; and most importantly, generate explanations and step-by-step reasoning for\\nthe responses, as prompted.\\nId.

Determine which sentence is not logical based on the difference.\\nNow let’s apply these steps to the given sentences:\\n1. Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\\n- This sentence suggests that people in the desert are eagerly anticipating a flood. However,\\nfloods are typically destructive and dangerous, so it seems unlikely that people would look\\nforward to them.\\n2.

Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that Sentence A is not logical as it\\nsuggests that people in the desert look forward to something that is typically harmful and\\ndangerous. Therefore, the answer is Sentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to\\nflood\".\\n### GPT4 :\\nTo determine which sentence is not logical, let’s examine each sentence and its meaning in\\nthe context of people living in a desert.\\nSentence A: \"people in the desert often look forward to flood\"\\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting a flood.

It is not logical for people to look forward to\\nsuch a disastrous event.\\nSentence B: \"people in the desert often look forward to rain\"\\n- This sentence implies that people living in a desert are eagerly awaiting rain. Rain is\\ntypically beneficial in a desert environment, as it provides water for drinking, agriculture,\\nand replenishing natural resources. It is logical for people living in a desert to look forward\\nto rain, as it can bring relief from the harsh, dry conditions.\\nBased on the analysis of both sentences, it can be concluded that Sentence A (“people\\nin the desert often look forward to flood”) is not logical, as it suggests that people are\\neagerly anticipating a destructive event, which is not a reasonable expectation.

Essentially, we leverage ChatGPT as\\nintermediate teacher assistant for two reasons.\\n•Capacity gap: Orca with 13Bparameters is many times smaller than GPT-4 (size\\nundisclosed). Leveraging an intermediate teacher with reduced gap in capabilities, in this\\ncase ChatGPT, has been shown to improve imitation learning performance for smaller\\nstudents in knowledge distillation [ 15]. This can be viewed as a form of progressive\\nlearning or curriculum learning, where the student first learns from easier examples,\\nfollowed by harder ones: with the assumption that longer responses are difficult to mimic\\nthan shorter ones, along with improved reasoning and step-by-step explanation from a\\nlarger teacher.\\n•Cost12andTime13: Large-scaledatacollectionfromAzureOpenAIAPI’sareconstrained\\nby, (a) rate limit in terms of allowed requests per minute to prevent throttling the\\nendpoints, (b) available tokens per minute due to serving latency, and (c) the dollar cost\\nfor length of prompt and token completion (demonstrated in Table 4) with the ChatGPT\\nAPI being much faster and cheaper than the GPT-4 endpoint. To this end, we collect\\n5×as much data from ChatGPT compared to GPT-4.\\nFigure 9 shows the response length distribution for ChatGPT and GPT-4 corresponing to\\ndifferent system messages. We observe that GPT-4 responses are on an average 1.5×longer\\nthan that of ChatGPT. This allows Orca to progressively learn from increasing complexity\\nof teacher explanations. We demonstrate the impact of teacher assistance via ablation\\nexperiments.\\n3.2 Training\\nThis section provides an overview of the training process for Orca, covering different aspects\\nof tokenization, sequencing, and loss computation.\\nTokenization : We utilize the LLaMA Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer for processing\\nthe input examples. Notably, the LLaMA tokenizer splits all numbers into individual digits,\\nand fallbacks to bytes to decompose unknown UTF-8 characters. To deal with variable\\nlength sequences we add a padding token “[[PAD]]” into the LLaMA tokenizer vocabulary.\\nThe resulting vocabulary contains 32,001tokens.\\nPacking : To optimize the training process and utilize the available computational resources\\nefficiently, we employ the packing technique [ 26]. This method involves concatenating\\n11https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/\\n12https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/\\nopenai-service/\\n13https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quotas-limits\\n13',\n",
              " 'multiple input examples into a single sequence, which is then used for training the model.\\nThe packing is performed such that the total length of the concatenated sequence does\\nnot exceed max_len = 2,048tokens. Particularly, we shuffle the input examples and then\\npartition the examples into groups such that length of the concatenated sequence in each\\ngroup is at most max_len . Padding tokens are then added to the concatenated sequence to\\nachieve a uniform input sequence length of max_len with a packing factor of 2.7examples\\nper sequence given the length distribution of augmented instructions in our training data.\\nLoss: For the purpose of training Orca, we compute the loss onlyon the tokens generated\\nby the teacher model, i.e., it learns to generate responses conditioned on the system message\\nand task instructions. This approach ensures that the model focuses on learning from the\\nmost relevant and informative tokens, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of\\nthe training process.\\nCompute: We trained Orca on 20NVIDIA A 100GPUs with 80GB memory. It took 160\\nhours to train Orca on FLAN-5M (ChatGPT augmentations) for 4epochs, and 40hours to\\ncontinue training on FLAN-1M (GPT-4 augmentations) for the same number of epochs.\\nIt took 2 weeks and 3 weeks respectively to collect data from GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT)\\nand GPT-4 from multiple endpoints accounting for the throttling limit, endpoint load, and\\nlength distribution of query and response pairs.\\n4 Experiment Setup\\nWe setup a rigorous evaluation protocol that considers a host of different abilities including\\nwriting, comprehension, analytical, mathematical and logical reasoning.\\n4.1 Baselines\\nWe compare Orca14against the following baselines:\\n•Text-Davinci-003 (TD-003): Text-Davinci-003 belong to the GPT-3.515series of\\ngeneration model that is optimized for text completion.

Therefore,\\nwe can write the inequality as:\\n12n > 7n + 350\\nTo solve for n, we can subtract 7n from both sides:\\n5n > 350\\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 5 to isolate n:\\nn > 70\\nTherefore, the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the company will make\\na profit is n > 70.\\nTo justify this answer, we can plug in a value of n greater than 70 into the cost formula and\\nthe income formula and compare the results. For example, if we plug in n = 80, we get:\\nC = 7(80) + 350 = 910 Income = 12(80) = 960\\nSince the income is greater than the cost, the company will make a profit if it pro-\\nduces 80 items. We can also check that if we plug in a value of n less than or equal\\nto 70, the income will be less than or equal to the cost, so the company will not make a profit.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nStep 1: Write down the given cost function and the income per item.\\nThe cost function is given as C = 7n + 350, where C is the cost in dollars and n is the\\nnumber of items produced. The income per item is given as $12.\\nStep 2: Calculate the total income for selling n items.\\nThe total income for selling n items can be calculated by multiplying the income per item\\nby the number of items sold. So, the total income I can be represented as:\\nI = 12n\\nStep 3: Write down the condition for making a profit.\\nThe company makes a profit when the total income from selling a quantity of items is greater\\nthan the cost of producing that quantity of items. In other words, the profit condition can\\nbe represented as:\\nTotal Income > Total Cost I > C\\nStep 4: Substitute the expressions for total income and total cost from Steps 1 and 2 into\\nthe inequality from Step 3.\\n12n > 7n + 350\\nStep 5: Solve the inequality for n.\\nTo solve the inequality for n, first subtract 7n from both sides of the inequality:\\n12n - 7n > 7n - 7n + 350 5n > 350\\nNow, divide both sides of the inequality by 5:\\n5n / 5 > 350 / 5 n > 70\\nStep 6: State the inequality that gives all possible values of n for which the manager\\nestimates that the company will make a profit.\\n37',\n",

So, you can plug this value\\ninto the formula:\\nNumber of years = (100 / 20)\\nNumber of years = 5\\nIt will take 5 years for the item to double in value when it is growing at a 20% annual\\ngrowth rate.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe formula for calculating the number of years for an item to double is:\\n38',\n",

Help as much as you can.\\n### Human:\\nHow many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer.\\nYour explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\\n### Orca :\\nTo determine the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe following factors:\\n1. Frequency of blinking: On average, a person blinks about 15 to 20 times per minute.\\nThis number can vary depending on factors such as age, environmental conditions, and\\nindividual habits.\\n2. Lifespan: The average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nNow, let’s calculate the average number of blinks in a lifetime:\\n1. First, we need to determine the number of minutes in 72 years. There are 60 seconds in a\\nminute, so we multiply 72 years by 60 minutes per year:\\n39',\n",
              " '72 years * 60 minutes per year = 4,320 minutes\\n2. Next, we need to determine the number of blinks in 4,320 minutes. Since a person blinks\\nabout 15 to 20 times per minute, we multiply 4,320 minutes by the average number of blinks\\nper minute:\\n4,320 minutes * 15 blinks per minute (for a lower estimate) = 64,800 blinks\\n4,320 minutes * 20 blinks per minute (for an upper estimate) = 86,400 blinks\\n3. Finally, we need to choose the appropriate estimate based on the given range. For our\\nanswer, we will use the lower estimate of 64,800 blinks.\\nSo, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5\\nto 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this\\nwould equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:\\n1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have\\nmeasured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness.\\n2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day\\nawake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8\\nmillion times.\\n3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x\\n365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime.\\n4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of\\nblinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime\\n(2,922,000). This gives us a total of 14,084,400,000 blinks.\\n5. However, this estimate is based on the assumption that blink rate remains constant\\nthroughout a person’s lifetime. In reality, blink rate can vary depending on factors such as\\nage, health, and medication use. Therefore, the actual number of blinks in a lifetime may\\nbe higher or lower than our estimate.\\n### ChatGPT :\\nThe average human blinks about 15-20 times per minute, which translates to approximately\\n1,200 times per hour, 28,800 times per day, and 10,512,000 times per year.\\nAssuming an average lifespan of 80 years, we can calculate the total number of blinks\\nin a lifetime by multiplying the number of blinks per year by the number of years in a lifetime:\\n10,512,000 blinks per year x 80 years = 840,960,000 blinks in a lifetime\\nTherefore, the average human blinks approximately 840 million times in their lifetime.\\nHowever, it’s important to note that this number can vary depending on factors such as age,\\nhealth, and environment.\\n### GPT-4 :\\nTo estimate the number of times an average human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe average blink rate, the number of hours a person is awake per day, and the average\\nhuman lifespan. Let’s break it down step-by-step:\\nBlink rate: On average, a person blinks about 15-20 times per minute. We’ll use the average\\nof these two values, which is 17.5 blinks per minute.\\nHours awake per day: Assuming an average person sleeps for 8 hours a day, they would be\\nawake for 16 hours a day.\\n40',\n",
              " 'Minutes awake per day: To convert the hours awake to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, 16\\nhours * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.\\nBlinks per day: Now, we can calculate the number of blinks per day by multiplying the\\nblink rate by the minutes awake per day. So, 17.5 blinks/minute * 960 minutes/day =\\n16,800 blinks/day.\\nAverage human lifespan: The global average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nHowever, this number can vary depending on factors such as country, gender, and lifestyle.\\nDays in a lifetime: To find the total number of days in a lifetime, we multiply the average\\nlifespan by the number of days in a year. So, 72 years * 365 days/year = 26,280 days. (Note:\\nThis calculation does not account for leap years.)\\nTotal blinks in a lifetime: Finally, we can estimate the total number of blinks in a lifetime\\nby multiplying the blinks per day by the total number of days in a lifetime. So, 16,800\\nblinks/day * 26,280 days = 441,504,000 blinks.\\nBased on these calculations, the average human blinks approximately 441.5 million times\\nin a lifetime. Keep in mind that this is just an estimate, and individual blink rates and\\nlifespans can vary.\\nFigure 27: Case Study 8: Vicuna Eval Fermi\\n11.9 Spatial Reasoning\\n### System:\\nUser will you give you a task with some instruction.

A number of issues impact the quality of these\\nmodels, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs;\\nsmall scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous\\nevaluation resulting in overestimating the small model’s capability as they\\ntend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs . To\\naddress these challenges, we develop Orca, a 13-billion parameter model\\nthat learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from\\nrich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought\\nprocesses; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from\\nChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and',\n",
              " 'diverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses\\nconventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B\\nby more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-\\nBench Hard (BBH) and 42%on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity\\nwith ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance\\n(4pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic\\nexaminations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot\\nsettings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4.

However, a more meticulous\\nevaluation on reasoning benchmarks against human labels finds Vicuna to retain only 64%',\n",

This\\ndiscrepancy not only underscores the limitations of existing evaluation protocols with smaller\\nLLMs, but it also reveals their significant lag in reasoning and comprehension capabilities.\\nIn essence, these models may be articulate, but they may not necessarily possess robust\\nreasoning skills. In this study, we discuss some of the reasons behind these gaps and propose\\nstrategies for addressing them.\\n1.1 Challenges with Existing Methods\\nCurrent research on instruction-tuning to mimic the output of LFM’s like ChatGPT exhibits\\nnotable limitation in task diversity, query complexity, and data scaling. These observations\\nare corroborated in a recent study by Gudibande et al. [12], where the authors assert that\\n“model imitation is a false promise” since “broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation\\nwould require (1) a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets and (2) far more',\n",
              " 'diverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.”. Contrary to this\\nassertion, we demonstrate that both conditions (1) and (2) are attainable and that it is\\npossible to reduce the gap with proprietary LLM’s on multiple zero-shot benchmarks that\\nrequire sophisticated reasoning. We elaborate on these challenges below:\\nSimple instructions with limited diversity. The Self-Instruct [ 13] process involves using\\nan initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or\\noverly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated\\ninto the task pool for further iterations. Nonetheless, the resulting queries generated through\\nSelf-Instruct, such as “what are the three primary colors?\", “what is the capital of France?\", etc. ,\\ncan exhibit limitations in diversity and complexity. Both Alpaca [ 7] and WizardLM [ 8]\\nemploy a variant of self-instruct. WizardLM introduces the concept of Evol-Instruct, which\\ngradually rewrites the initial set of instructions into more complex versions, attempting to\\novercome some of the method’s inherent shortcomings. On the other hand, recent works',\n",

Prior works [ 15,16] on open-box model\\nshow that richer signals such as logits, intermediate representations and attention states can\\nsignificantly improve distillation performance. While they are not accessible for closed-box\\nLFM’s7, recent work [ 17] demonstrates that richer signals like LFM rationales can help close\\nthe gap for task-specific distillation.\\nEvaluation: Previous studies on instruction tuning of small models with LFMs are severely\\nlimited in their evaluation protocol. They often rely on GPT-4 for auto-evaluation by asking\\nit to compare the outputs of two systems with a prompt like “given responses from system\\n1 (reference) and system 2 (target), which one is better?”. However, this approach has\\nseveral drawbacks, such as the small size of test sets (e.g., 80instructions in Vicuna and 218\\ninstructions in WizardLM) and the biases of GPT-4 as the judge [ 18]. For example, we notice\\nthat models that are instruction-tuned with GPT-4 responses tend to generate longer texts',\n",
              " 'that GPT-4 prefers over shorter ones; as well as GPT-4 has a bias in the order of the candidate\\nresponses. We will show that such auto-evaluation measures overestimate the abilities of\\nsmaller models compared to LFMs, as the former are much weaker in comprehension and\\nreasoning skills.\\n1.2 Key Contributions\\nIn this research, our focus is on addressing the challenges mentioned above, specifically with:\\nExplanation tuning: We augment⟨query, response⟩pairs with detailed responses from\\nGPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These\\nprovide the student with additional signals for learning. We leverage system instructions (e.g..,\\nexplain like I’m five, think step-by-step and justify your response , etc.) to\\nelicit such explanations. This is in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning, which only uses the\\nprompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the\\nLFM’s “thought” process.\\nScaling tasks and instructions: We utilize the Flan 2022 Collection [ 19] as it provides\\nan extensive public assortment of tasks and instructions.

These prompts are used to query LFMs like\\nChatGPT and GPT-4, thus creating a rich and diverse training set.

Help as much as you can.\\n### Human:\\nHow many times does the average human blink in a lifetime? Try to explain your answer.\\nYour explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.\\n### Orca :\\nTo determine the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime, we need to consider\\nthe following factors:\\n1. Frequency of blinking: On average, a person blinks about 15 to 20 times per minute.\\nThis number can vary depending on factors such as age, environmental conditions, and\\nindividual habits.\\n2. Lifespan: The average human lifespan is approximately 72 years.\\nNow, let’s calculate the average number of blinks in a lifetime:\\n1. First, we need to determine the number of minutes in 72 years. There are 60 seconds in a\\nminute, so we multiply 72 years by 60 minutes per year:\\n3972 years * 60 minutes per year = 4,320 minutes',\n",
              " '2. Next, we need to determine the number of blinks in 4,320 minutes. Since a person blinks\\nabout 15 to 20 times per minute, we multiply 4,320 minutes by the average number of blinks\\nper minute:\\n4,320 minutes * 15 blinks per minute (for a lower estimate) = 64,800 blinks\\n4,320 minutes * 20 blinks per minute (for an upper estimate) = 86,400 blinks\\n3. Finally, we need to choose the appropriate estimate based on the given range. For our\\nanswer, we will use the lower estimate of 64,800 blinks.\\nSo, the average number of times a human blinks in a lifetime is approximately 64,800 blinks.\\n### Vicuna :\\nThe average human blinks about 20-25 times per minute, which means they blink about 1.5\\nto 2 million times per year. Over the course of an average human lifespan of 80 years, this\\nwould equate to approximately 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 blinks.\\nTo arrive at this estimate, we can use the following reasoning:',\n",
              " '1. The average blink duration is about 0.3 seconds. This is based on studies that have\\nmeasured the duration of eye closure during sleep and during wakefulness.\\n2. The average person spends about 6-8 hours per day sleeping, and about 16 hours per day\\nawake and alert. This means that during the day, a person blinks about 16 x 0.3 = 4.8\\nmillion times.\\n3. The average lifespan is about 80 years. This means that a person spends about 80 x\\n365.25 x 24 = 2,922,000 hours awake and alert during their lifetime.\\n4. To calculate the total number of blinks during a lifetime, we can multiply the number of\\nblinks per day (4.8 million) by the number of hours spent awake and alert during a lifetime\\n(2,922,000).
