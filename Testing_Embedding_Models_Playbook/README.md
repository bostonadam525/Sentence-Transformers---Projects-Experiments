# Testing Embedding Models Playbook
* A repository by Adam Lang


# Overview
* When you choose an embedding model for your application what is your approach? While there are benchmarks such as the MTEB and BEIR, there are various Data Science and Machine Learning techniques that can be utilized.
* I like to think of this as a "physical fitness test" or A/B testing for embedding models. While most of the time we can pick an embedding model off the shelf by eyeing the dimensions, context window/length, training data, training tasks and more, how do we really know if its the right embedding model for our data?
* I will review and share a myriad of techniques that I have researched and collected so that everyone is aware of "what is possible" when considering the best embedding model for their application.
